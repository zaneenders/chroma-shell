# ``ChromaShell``

A package to add more Chroma to your Swift terminal life.

Chroma can be added to your shell projects incrementally by using just the wrapper functions to wrap text in ansi escape codes. or build terminal frames with the ``ChromaFrame`` and using the method to get the generated AnsiString that you can write out to the terminal where you can use Blocks to describe the layout of the frame. Or fully embrace a ``ChromaShell`` experience and use the ChromaShell protocol to build your UI.
